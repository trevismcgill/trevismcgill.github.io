This past week has been mostly spent in Ruby land. Ever since I learned what the difference was between frontend and backend, I have enjoyed working on the backend much much more. I am not very artistic, and so concerning myself with manipulating data has been far more interesting and enjoyable for me than scrutinizing over how many pixels left or right some input box should be.
